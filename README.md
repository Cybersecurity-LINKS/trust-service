## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? --> 

This project is a microservice for creating and verifying proofs of data authenticity and data integrity. The application store the proofs on the [IOTA Tangle](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/). To answer the requirement that a user should not own crypto tokens, a centralized approach has been used where the service handles the identity keys of the user.

## Installation
<!-- What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. -->

### Requirements

- `Rust` and `Cargo`. Follow the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) to install them. 
- `Docker` and `Docker compose`


### Running locally


For testing the application with MongoDB, follow these steps:

- Run `docker compose up -d --profile dev` to start the MongoDB container.
- Create a database called `MODERATE`.
- Create a collection called `Users`.
- Use [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) to view the database content.
Note: MongoDB Compass is a tool that can be used to interact with MongoDB databases and inspect their content.

Create smart contract rust bindings (mandatory the first time)
```shell
# assuming the ipr-management folder is located in the same root folder of trust-service
cd abigen
cargo run -- --contract AssetFactory --abi-source "../../ipr-management/artifacts/contracts/AssetFactory.sol/AssetFactory.json"
cargo run -- --contract Asset --abi-source "../../ipr-management/artifacts/contracts/Asset.sol/Asset.json"
```

Then, launch the application: 
```shell
cd actix-server
cargo run --release --bin actix-trust-service
```

Beware of the configuration of the environment variables.
Note: Modify `.env` and `.mongo.env` reasonably. (`ADDR`, `MONGO_ENDPOINT`, `ASSET_FACTORY_ADDR`,`L2_PRIVATE_KEY`)

### Running via docker

Commands for building the appâ€™s container image and starting the app container:

```shell
docker compose --profile deploy up -d
```

Beware of the configuration of the environment variables.
Note: Modify `.env` and `.mongo.env` reasonably. (`ADDR`, `MONGO_ENDPOINT`, `ASSET_FACTORY_ADDR`,`L2_PRIVATE_KEY`)
