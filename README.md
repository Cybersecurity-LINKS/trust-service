## Description

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn? --> 

This project is a microservice for creating and verifying proofs of data authenticity and data integrity. The application store the proofs on the [IOTA Tangle](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/). To answer the requirement that a user should not own crypto tokens, a centralized approach has been used where the service handles the identity keys of the user.
